==========================
Input filename: ../fq/test3.2.fq
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.4_dev
Cutadapt version: 1.18
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'GATCGGAAGAGCA' (user defined)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Optional adapter 2 sequence (only used for read 2 of paired-end files): 'GATCGGAAGAGCA'
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
File was specified to be an MspI-digested RRBS sample. Read 1 sequences with adapter contamination will be trimmed a further 2 bp from their 3' end, and Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 5' end to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)

RUN STATISTICS FOR INPUT FILE: ../fq/test3.2.fq
=============================================
273496 sequences processed in total
Sequences were truncated to a varying degree because of deteriorating qualities (Phred score quality cutoff: 20):	91544 (33.5%)
RRBS reads trimmed by additional 2 bp when adapter contamination was detected:	0 (0.0%)

Total number of sequences analysed for the sequence pair length validation: 273496

Number of sequence pairs removed because at least one read was shorter than the length cutoff (20 bp): 0 (0.00%)
